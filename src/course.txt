new things i learn today i.e
=> single page application importants in new modern websites which helps to build client side page rendering ,
we can create multiple pages or component to load in single html page and switch multiple page with  useing anchor tags.
=> route is use to set path of component
=> switch is to switch into multiple page but it matches first occurencs of given path load it on same page to avoid this we 
can use exact prop  to match whole path
=> Link is used to navigate the different routes on the site. 
=> NavLink is used to add the style attributes to the active routes. 
=> reDirect when user put wrong path to input if doesn't found then reDirect to given path 
=> useParams extract dynamic path of component, from given route path which denote by ":anystring"
